The project focused on developing the ability to collect, process, and visualize environmental data using Power BI, with a specific emphasis on analyzing and interpreting carbon emissions across multiple countries, sectors, and time periods. The objective was to enhance data storytelling skills through interactive dashboards that effectively represent sector-wise, country-wise, and year-wise carbon footprint distributions. Using tools like Power BI Desktop and Microsoft Excel, data was first collected from various sources (such as India_Carbon_Emission and summary_of_carbon_emission datasets) in CSV or Excel format, covering the years 2019 to 2023. Microsoft Excel was utilized for initial data preprocessing, which involved organizing tabular data and performing basic aggregations and formatting. The cleaned and structured data was then imported into Power BI, where it was further transformed and modeled by establishing relationships between tables representing countries, sectors, and years. Key features of Power BI such as slicers, filters, bar charts, pie charts, line graphs, treemaps, and tables were used to build an interactive and visually engaging dashboard. In some cases, DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) was applied to create calculated columns and measures, for example, to compute total emissions, percentage shares, or year-over-year changes. The dashboard enabled users to dynamically filter data by country, sector, and year, making it easy to explore trends, patterns, and insights. Through this visualization, major contributing sectors and countries to carbon emissions were identified, and temporal changes were effectively tracked. Ultimately, the project demonstrated how Power BI can transform raw environmental data into meaningful insights, supporting data-driven decision-making for environmental awareness, policy formulation, and sustainability initiatives.
